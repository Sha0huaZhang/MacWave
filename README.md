# 🌊 What is MacWave? 

MacWave is a **package manager** that runs on **macOS/Linux**, specifically designed to host **iOS/iPadOS jailbreak-related software packages** for jailbreak developers and researchers. These packages are **typically not included in mainstream package managers**. Previously, jailbreak projects required downloading from various scattered sources. Now, you only need a single terminal command.
# 🌊 Install MacWave    
In the terminal, run the following command:        
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sha0huaZhang/MacWave/main/install.sh)"
```
⚠️ **Important**: After installation, **restart your terminal** or **run the following command** to apply PATH changes immediately:
```
source ~/.zshrc
```

(If you are using bash instead of zsh, run ```source ~/.bashrc```)

# Uninstall MacWave

In the terminal, run the following command:     

```
/bin/bash -c "INSTALL_DIR=\"\$HOME/.local/macwave\"; echo -e \"\033[31mYou are deleting MacWave, are you sure? [Y/n]\033[0m\"; read -n 1 -r; echo; if [[ ! \$REPLY =~ ^[Yy]\$ ]]; then echo \"🌊 Uninstall cancelled.\"; exit 0; fi; if [ -d \"\$INSTALL_DIR\" ]; then echo \"🌊 Removing \$INSTALL_DIR...\"; rm -rf \"\$INSTALL_DIR\"; else echo \"🌊 MacWave installation directory not found. Skipping.\"; fi; for RC_FILE in \"\$HOME/.zshrc\" \"\$HOME/.bashrc\"; do if [ -f \"\$RC_FILE\" ]; then sed -i '' '/# MacWave/d' \"\$RC_FILE\" 2>/dev/null || true; sed -i '' '/export PATH=\".*macwave\\/bin/d' \"\$RC_FILE\" 2>/dev/null || true; echo \"🌊 Removed MacWave PATH entries from \$RC_FILE\"; fi; done; echo \"\"; echo \"🌊 MacWave has been uninstalled.\"; echo \"🌊 Please restart your terminal to apply changes.\""
```

⚠️ **Important:** This command **permanently removes MacWave and its configuration files**. Make sure you have **copied the entire command correctly** before pressing Enter.
