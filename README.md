# 🌊 What is MacWave? 

MacWave is a **package manager** that runs on **macOS/Linux**, specifically designed to host **iOS/iPadOS jailbreak-related software packages** for jailbreak developers and researchers. These packages are **typically not included in mainstream package managers**. Previously, jailbreak projects required downloading from various scattered sources. Now, you only need a single terminal command.
# 🌊 Install MacWave    
In the terminal, run the following command:        
```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sha0huaZhang/MacWave/main/install.sh | bash
```
⚠️ **Important**: After installation, **restart your terminal** or **run the following command** to apply PATH changes immediately:
```
source ~/.zshrc
```

(If you are using bash instead of zsh, run ```source ~/.bashrc```)
